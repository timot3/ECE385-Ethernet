# ECE385-Ethernet
ECE 385 Final Project -- Ethernet on MAX10-DE10 Lite FPGA


## Documentation

### To Run
Connect custom shield to FPGA, connect ethernet and keyboard (depending on which test program you're running)

Program FPGA through Quartus like normal. 

To run the C++ code (and all the networking stuff), select the program number you'd like to run via the macro near the top of main.cpp. If the program allows keyboard input and you'd like to use it, set the keyboard macro to 1.
